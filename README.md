The icon component generator uses the icon datasets (but not the API) provided by [Iconify](https://github.com/iconify/icon-sets/).

The icon set libraries within are simply repackaging of the original icons.  Each icon set is provided by their original authors under different licenses; check the licenses from the individual packages and their original websites for more details.
